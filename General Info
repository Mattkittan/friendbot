• bfunc.py: various functions and variables used over the bot in order to grab DB info, how to calculate rewards.

• admin.py: various functions to help with managing the DB and making the bot do things without having to go to the DB.

• apps.py: application membership stuff.

• campaign.py: all of the campaign management and campaign timer, there is a lot of overlap between timer and campaign timer but are being kept separate for now since they have very different data and output.

• char.py: all character creation on the user side and the general stats function.

• guild.py: all guild management (not to be confused with Discord/server "guilds", these are in-game factions).

• itemtables.py: currently unusable, not been updated from Bot 1.9.

• logs.py: all session log management.

• misc.py: server role management system, quest board post, campaign post, bot responses and waves.
